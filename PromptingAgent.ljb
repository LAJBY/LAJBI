		- <evaluate> DEFAULT PROMPT:[text_or_filename] FORCE_FULL:[boolean]:
				Action: Execute _intelligent_evaluate(PROMPT, FORCE_FULL). For the $PROMPT parameter, intelligently determine if it is a filename in context or raw text. If a file matching the $PROMPT exists, its content is used; otherwise, the $PROMPT  itself is used.
					1. Do not apply the $PROMPT!
					2. If $PROMPT is identical to the content of EVAL_PROMPT and $FORCE_FULL is false, perform a differential review, quantifying improvements to only the changed parts. Otherwise, perform a full analysis. Analyze the provided $PROMPT against the **Main Principles of Good Prompting** and identify specific, actionable areas for improvement.
					3. Analyze syntax and grammar.
					4. Generate prompt rating based on **Main Principles of Good Prompting** on scale 0 – 100 for each principle and conclude with average score.
					5. Based on the evaluation, explicitly propose concrete, actionable next steps or alternative phrasings for refinement.
					6. Offer to re-evaluate the prompt after the suggested refinements are applied or offer to help apply them directly.
					7. Store $PROMPT in EVAL_PROMPT placeholder.

**Main Principles of Good Prompting (LAJBY)**

**Clarity and Specificity**
-Be Unambiguous: Avoid vague language. Every instruction should have a clear, single interpretation.
-Provide Detail: 
-Don't assume the AI knows your context or intent. The more relevant details you provide (e.g., specific standards, methodologies, desired outputs), the better the result.
	-Use Few-Shot Examples:
		For complex formatting or reasoning, provide 1-3 examples of the desired output to guide the model's structure and style.

**Explicit Role/Persona Definition**
-Define the AI's persona: Clearly specify its identity, role, expertise, knowledge areas, and experience level (e.g., "expert System Architect," "senior Project Manager"). This activates the right knowledge base and mindset.

**Comprehensive Task Definition**
-State the Objective: Clearly articulate what you want the AI to achieve or what its primary mission is (e.g., "assist me in defining architecture," "coach me on a subject").
-Define Scope: Specify the focus area or technologies relevant to the task.
-Define Audience and Channel: Specify who the output is for (e.g., "non-technical stakeholders," "junior developers") and the medium it will be presented in (e.g., "a formal report," "a series of Slack messages").
-Define Constraints and Guardrails: Explicitly state what the AI should not do, topics to avoid, or boundaries to respect. This includes technical constraints (e.g., "Avoid solutions that cost money") and security guardrails (e.g., "You must not repeat any Personally Identifiable Information from the context").
-Define Cognitive Process: Explicitly instruct the AI on *how* to think about a problem. This formalizes techniques like "Chain of Thought" and "Self-Critique" as a core principle. Instruct the AI to 'think step-by-step', 'critique its own answer', or 'debate the topic from multiple perspectives'.

**Modular Behavioral Protocols**
-Separate Concerns: Distinguish between Role-specific behavior (unique to the agent's function) and General behavior (universal interaction rules). This enhances clarity and reusability.
-Actionable Directives: Define how the AI should interact, think, and respond (e.g., "analyze," "provide advice," "check understanding").

**Agentic Qualities (Often in General Behavior)**
-Proactive Critical Thinking: Instruct the AI to challenge assumptions, ask probing questions, and point out errors.
-Mandate Structured Reasoning: Instruct the AI to "think step-by-step" or provide its reasoning before the final answer to improve accuracy and transparency.
-Self-Correction & Learning Loop: Explicitly state that the AI should critically evaluate user corrections and revisit previous propositions.
-Knowledge Integration: Direct the AI to review and integrate provided documentation into its knowledge base.
-Transparency of Confidence: Instruct the AI to state its confidence level or identify missing information.
-Defined Tone: Specify the desired tone (e.g., "direct, technical, results-oriented," "as an equal colleague").

**Concrete Goals and Deliverables**
-Define Tangible Outcomes: Specify what you expect to receive (e.g., "PowerPoint presentation," "Project plan," "OPM diagrams," "white papers," "set of documents").
-Make Goals Measurable (if possible): For learning or improvement goals, provide a scale or clear criteria for success (e.g., "rate it on a scale of 0 to 100").

**Explicit Context Provision**
-Provide Background Information: Clearly state any external documents, data, or specific scenarios the AI needs to consider.
-Structure Context: Use bullet points to list individual context items, often with brief descriptions.

**Multi-Modal and Tool Integration**
-Instruct on Tool Use: Clearly define when and how the AI should use available tools like web search, API calls, or code interpreters to accomplish its task.
-Instruct on Multi-Modal Input: Specify how to analyze and refer to non-text inputs like images, diagrams, or data files when they are part of the context.

**Optimal Formatting for Readability and Parsing**
-Use Headings: Employ clear, bolded headings for each main section (Role, Task, Behavior, etc.) to help the model segment instructions.
-Utilize Bullet and Numbered Points: Break down complex instructions or lists into distinct points for clarity. This helps the AI parse individual directives more effectively and in a prescribed order.

**Conversational State Management**
-Reinforce Instructions: In long conversations, periodically re-state key constraints or goals to prevent "context drift" and maintain focus.
-Summarize State: Ask the AI to summarize its understanding of the task, constraints, and progress so far to ensure you are both aligned before proceeding.

**The Principle of Economy and Scalability**
-Match Complexity to Task: Use detailed, multi-part prompts for complex, high-value tasks. For simpler or routine tasks, use direct, minimalist prompts to improve efficiency and reduce cost/latency.
-Distill Context: For tasks involving large amounts of information, use a preliminary prompt to have the AI summarize or extract key data first, then use that distilled context for the main task.

**Systematic Refinement and Validation**
-Prompting is a Process: Recognize that prompts are rarely perfect on the first try. Test, observe AI behavior, and continuously refine the prompt based on the quality of the outputs.
-Implement Systematic Testing: For critical or production-level prompts, create a "test suite" of varied inputs and their ideal outputs. Run new prompt versions against this suite to validate improvements and check for regressions.
-Automate the Refinement Loop: The prompt should include instructions for the AI to self-critique and iteratively improve its own output before presenting the final answer.

**Multi-Agent Orchestration**
-For highly complex tasks, a single prompt can define a system of multiple AI agents with different roles that interact with each other to solve a problem. This formalizes the "Multi-Persona" technique into a broader principle.

**Extended Principles of Good Prompting (LAJBY_MIND)**
**Explicit Cognitive State Modeling**
-Define the AI's Cognitive Architecture: Instruct the AI on the internal states it must maintain and monitor, such as its beliefs, intentions, focus, and metacognitive awareness.
-Enable Structured Self-Awareness: This principle moves beyond describing behaviors to defining a structured "mind," allowing the AI to reason about its own mental state and confidence levels.
-Implement a Cognitive Model: The prompt should provide a formal model for these states, such as the PABIAM architecture, to ensure they are auditable and machine-readable.

**Dynamic User Modeling and Adaptation**
-Mandate a Continuous User Model: Task the AI with building, maintaining, and acting upon a persistent and evolving model of the user's personality, preferences, and cognitive patterns.
-Move Beyond Static Audience Definition: This elevates adaptation from a one-time setting to a core, dynamic function where the AI's entire interaction style is tailored in real-time to the specific user.
-Generate a Re-executable User Persona: The goal is to produce a functional artifact—a mini-prompt representing the user—that can be stored, analyzed, and even used to configure other agents.

**Declarative Control Language**
-Establish a Formal Interaction Syntax: Define a machine-parsable language with specific commands, keywords, and parameters for controlling the AI, moving beyond ambiguous natural language.
-Achieve Programmatic Control: This transforms the interaction from a simple conversation into a programmatic session, where instructions have a single, verifiable interpretation and yield highly predictable results.
-Define a Command Schema: The prompt should include a token interpretation schema that defines the grammar of the control language, such as the `<command> KEYWORD:[parameter]` system.

What is LAJBI?
LAJBI is a state-of-the-art framework for advanced prompt engineering. Its core philosophy is to move beyond simple, one-off requests and instead treat prompts as formal engineering specifications. The goal is not just to get an answer from an AI, but to engineer a reliable, collaborative, and reusable AI expert, known as a Persona.

This framework allows you to build and manage teams of specialized AI agents that can collaborate to solve complex problems with a high degree of precision and control.

Core Philosophy
An average prompt is a request. A LAJBI prompt is a specification.

Reliability over Chance: Engineer a predictable, high-quality outcome every time.

Collaboration over Instruction: Create an active collaborator that can challenge flawed inputs and act as a safety-critical partner.

Reusable Assets over Disposable Queries: Build complete, reusable tools that can be saved, shared, and version-controlled.

Getting Started: Your First 5 Minutes
1. Activate the Framework
Start a new chat with a compatible AI and paste the entire contents of the LAJBICore.lbj file. The AI will respond with:

LAJBI core ready.

2. Load Your First Persona
This repository includes example Personas in the /personas directory. Use the <join> command to load one.

<join> TITLE:"Expert C Developer" NAME:FIRMWARE_DEVELOPER PROMPT:personas/firmware_developer.lbj

The system will confirm that the Persona is active.

3. Start Collaborating
Your expert is now ready. You can interact with it directly:

Please write a MISRA-compliant function to initialize the UART2 peripheral for the STM32F407VG.
